                    My name is Julian.<br>
                    I'm a passionate Mechatronic Engineer that loves coding. More than five years of experience as an engineer have built a
                    programmer with solid foundations, resourceful in problem solving and with
                    integrated assertive communication skills, which allows me to perform effectively
                    within a work team. Planning, design, execution, testing and maintenance of
                    engineering projects, have been tasks in which I have succeeded during my career.
